# AI-Based Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project was developed as part of our "Software Project Management" course at Sichuan University, and it aims to provide users with quick and accurate predictions for various diseases based on their symptoms and medical data. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both patients and doctors.
- **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**: Enter your symptoms and get a list of possible diseases using our AI-powered Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
- **Skin Cancer Detection**: Upload an image and our Deep Neural Network will predict the likelihood of skin cancer.
- **Lung Cancer Detection**: Similar to skin cancer, upload an image for lung cancer prediction using our trained neural networks.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Input your medical data and find out the probability of having diabetes with our Gradient Boosting Algorithm.
- **Breast Cancer Detection**: Use our Random Forest Algorithm to predict the chances of breast cancer based on your data.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Assess your risk of heart disease using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## Technologies Used

Our project leverages a range of modern technologies to ensure high performance and ease of use:

- **Frontend**: Built with React JS for a responsive and interactive user experience, styled with Material-UI and Bootstrap for clean and professional design.
- **Backend**: Powered by Django and Django REST Framework, providing a robust and scalable backend.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Utilized Scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms and TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models.
- **Algorithms**: Implemented various algorithms including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks.

## Team Members

This project was brought to life by a dedicated team of developers:

- **A K M Muhitul Islam**: Developed the interfaces for Skin Cancer Detection and Diabetes Prediction.
- **MD Kamrul Islam**: Worked on the interface for Random Disease Detection, Heart Disease Detection.
- **Iqbal Hossian Limon**: Created the interfaces for Lung Cancer Detection and managed the patient and doctor login/logout functionality.
- **Md Naim Hassan Saykat**: Focused on the interface for Breast Cancer Detection.
